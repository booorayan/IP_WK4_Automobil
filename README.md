Cleaning and Analysis of Automobil dataset, 15/07/2019

#### By **Boorayan**
## Description
This notebok presents a data anaysis on the Automobil dataset to determine the most popular hour for picking up a shared electric car. The analysis entails the cleaning of the data, data formatting and the final stage of analysis.

## Issues
A number of assumptions were made during the analysis to arrive at particular conclusions. negative values were taken to mean that cars had been picked up and positive values were interpreted to mean that cars had been returned to their stations.
Another assumption was that the count of station and postal code was directly related to the popularity of the station and postal code.

## Technologies Used
For this project, pandas and numpy were the libraries employed.
